Data Scientist with 5+ years across retail, energy, and healthcare. I build forecasting, retention, and risk models and turn them into practical tools and dashboards that drive decisions. Highlights include improving forecasting accuracy by **68%** (inventory/logistics) and reducing 30-day hospital readmissions by **15%** via ML-driven early-intervention insights.
